Welcome to the **WEB SURGE 2025** repository, an event conducted jointly by **Vector The Design Club** and **Dcodr The Coding Club**.
Problem Statements will be uploaded on 24th March

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up your repository and start working on your project:

### 1. Install Git
Ensure Git is installed on your system. Download it from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### 2. Fork the Repository
Create your own copy of this repository by forking it. If you're unsure how, watch this [How do i fork this Repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9ftoxZ2X9g).

### 3. Clone Your Fork
Clone your forked repository to your local machine using the command:
```bash
 git clone <your-forked-repository-URL>
```

### 4. Develop Locally
Write and test your code on your local machine. Make regular commits to track your progress.

### 5. Push Your Code
Once your code is ready, push your changes to your forked repository (not this original repository). If you need help, watch this [How do i push the code?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLmpKKaQL54).
